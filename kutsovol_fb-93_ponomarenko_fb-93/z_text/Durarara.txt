This is an unusual story:

- Seiji-san! Seiji-san! Are you home? I'm here again! Oh my god, did you accidentally leave the door closed again? Now I can't login!

Danger, danger. A stalker invaded my house. She bangs on my door, can't even take the bell. What the hell is she thinking about?

- The door is closed! Seiji-san, you're not sleeping, are you? Ah, I came to the sleeping guy for the first time. I'm so brave!

Attention, attention ... Everything was in order a week ago. Last week I saved two girls from a bully who was chasing them. It turned out that they were going to the same school where I entered and will be in the same first grade. But I never expected that everything would turn out like this. The other girl was a polite little prude, but this ...

- You know ... actually I ... I've always liked Seiji-san! Do you remember? During the entrance exam, I sat right next to Seiji-san. The guy on the right had such an amazing name - Ryugamine Mikado, and I wanted to know the name of the person on the left, so I turned around and ... it was love at first sight! From that day on, I will forever remember Seiji-san's name! Although I didn't have the courage to confess to you that very day ... but last week Seiji-san saved me, and at that moment I thought ... Ah, that must be fate! Do you know how much courage it gave me? So let me look at you again. Seiji-san, I really want to see your strong and energetic face! Please, please, please sweet Seiji-san!

Careful, careful. After I rescued this child, she secretly pursued me all the way to my house. And after that, she did it every day. Even after I asked her many times to get away from me. This is the shit that she was screaming now, I've heard it two thousand times.

- Don't tell me you're sick, Seiji-san ?! Are you so sick that you can't answer me? This is bad! Hurry up and open the door, Seiji-san! Ever since the entrance exam, I've been looking for information about you! I know your birthday, I know about your family ... everything about you!
